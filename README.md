Since the website main porpose is to promote genealogy service consulting business, the basic information about the service and a way to contact the service provider was a must for the minimal viable product. I additional to these basic functionalies, the trigger questions and the google search release were added to hopefully increase the users' interest for investing on family history.

## Design Choices

### Colors
- Base colors
  - Neutral colors such as white black, tones of gray
    - Those colors were choosen as the base colors because the pages will have pictures with a variaty of colors and a neutral back ground will not interfear with pics. It does not draw the attention from the main pics which are key elements to draw to increse user interest in genealogy and faily history. The colors decision was based on the target audience for the website. Family history photos are one of the most rewarding results from genenalogy.

### Typography (???):
  - Font style:
    - the fonts were inspired from websites meant for high income audience. This choice was based on the fact that the target audience for genealogy consulting is medium or higher income audience.
  - Font size: 
    - The font on the top of the index.html page is the biggest because it is title of the page
    - Below the title there is the subtitle.
    
    - Title and subtitle are the biggest latters because they are the brand of the business and they give the user a clue of what is the website about.
    
    - the title of the site and under the text Lauri Figueiro name are in cursive font type . this is because those fonts are classy and this site supposed to have a high end feeling due to its target market which are middle or higher income.
    - pics

- the trigger questions are written in very large size because it is supposed to draw attention to the content associated to it.
- The letters they become smaller as the number of characters in it, increases.
- Bigger letters are meant to draw the users attention.
- Smaller carachters are meant to be more informative.


    - 
    - Font types for 
      - the title of the site and under the text Lauri Figueiro are in cursive font for historical and branding type for branding purposes. Genealogy is about study of the past and many documents on the past were written with cursive letters. Also, cursive letters are adobted by heigh end websites or brands. Since the target market are middle or higher income, the cusive letter becames a good alternative.
      - 
  - how fonts ties into users' emotions or target audience
  - include screenshots of fonts used and links to the appropriate

### Images
Explain why you used certain icons and images on your site

- Banner image and contact us images:
  The image on the banner and on the contact page are base on the phylosofical side of genealogy. It satifies basic human curiosity (http://www.genealogyintime.com/articles/why-genealogy-is-important-page3.html):
  1- The past - Where do I come from?
  2- The present - Why I am here?
  3- The future - What is going to happen to me?
Both images shows locations with proper scenario for a phylosofical experience.  Also, a huge part of the genealogy is the family tree. For these reasons there are trees on the those images. See images below(???):
  
 - Trigger question's images: The images on the trigger questions were placed there because they have to do with the trigger questions.Those pictures they also look old on purpose. This is because genealogy has a lot to do with the past.
  
- Search page images: these pictures are old looking pictures to inspire people to look for pictures using the search tool.

 - The logo was picked because it look like there is a tree that is usually associated to genealogy trees.

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/utilities/display/) 
    - The navigation bar (in all pages), the photo gallery (Questions section) portions of the index.html, and contact us portion of contact.html page were built with a template from **bootstrap** to speed up development. However, the templates have been modified from its original for customization purposes.   

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
    - **Google Fonts** was used to style the fonts of the project.

[Viewport](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_viewport.asp) 
    - Meta name **viewport** was also added in order to make the site responsive to different sizes of screen.

[Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/)
    - This technology was used to link APIs to the website (Google Search and Emailjs APIs)

[Jquery](https://jquery.com/)
    - This library was used to create an interactive User Interface (Zoom functionality found on the index.html "questions" sections)

[Jasmine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasmine_(JavaScript_testing_framework))
    - This framework was used to test javascript code, such as the code that validate the email input text box found in the contact.html page 



## Testing

Automated tests
1. Email validation
    - Go to https://gaberoids.github.io/genealogynow/assets/readme_files/tests.html to see test results.
    - The link to the test file: https://github.com/Gaberoids/genealogynow/blob/master/assets/spec/calcSpecs.js .
    - The link to the page where the function being tested is found: https://github.com/Gaberoids/genealogynow/blob/master/assets/js/calc.js .

Non-automated tests
1. Navigation bar:
    1. Go to the "Homapage" page
    2. Click on all links and buttons to see if they work and take the user to the pages they meant to go.
    3. Change the size of the screen to make sure that the navbar is presentable
    4. Click the links and button again in different size of screens to verify they still work (mainly when hamburger icon shows).

    2. Hover over the small pictures on the right side of the page and note the cursor turn into a magnifying glass.
    3. Click the small pics and notice that they exchange position with with the pic placed on the big frame.  
    4. Change sizes of the screens to make sure that the site is still presentable and functional on those sizes.

3. Search functionality:
    1. Go to the "geniusSearch.html" page and type "Perger" inside the search box.
    2. Note how the search returns many results.
    3. Note that the search results are related to the key words "Perger" (typed by the user) plus "family" and "genealogy" (default key words).

    8. To confirm that the email was sent go to gmail.com, log in into gmail.com with the following credentials:
        - User name: geniusgenealogy@gmail.com
        - Password: codeacademyadmin
    9. Note that an email was received from the website contact page.

    (*CLARIFICATION NOTE: Testing screen size means -> by increasing and decreasing the browser window and using developer tools to test site on mobile view.*)


**The pages in this website will be more simple in the mobile view compared to desktop view. For example:**
- links in the menu navigator will be replaced by the hamburger icon.
- In the index.html, the head shot from consultant will be removed on mobile screen.

**Bugs:**  
- There is an error message on index.html. It says "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'step' of undefined.". According to my research, this error has to do with Jquery CDNs. This bug is not breaking the page right now, so I left it alone for now.
